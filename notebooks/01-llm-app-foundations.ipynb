    "## Running the First App: Building an Index and Querying Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll run our first simple generative AI app. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run the app, you'll need to set up your OpenAI API key. Follow these steps to ensure everything works smoothly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain Your OpenAI API Key**:\n",
    "   - Go to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and sign up or log in to your account.\n",
    "   - Once logged in, generate an API key from the API settings page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Export the API Key**:\n",
    "   - You’ll need to export your API key as an environment variable. Use the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Make sure to replace `\"your_api_key_here\"` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Your Setup**:\n",
    "   - Check that your API key is correctly set by running:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     echo $OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This should print your API key if everything is set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your API key configured, you’re ready to dive into running and interacting with the generative AI app!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the `llama_index` library to index a set of documents and then query them for information. Here’s a breakdown of what each line of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Load and Prepare the Documents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We import the necessary classes from `llama_index`. The `SimpleDirectoryReader` is used to load all documents from the `data` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Load the data from your documents so that we can build an index for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\n",
    "documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"data\").load_data()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create the Index**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We create a `VectorStoreIndex` from the loaded documents. This index allows us to efficiently search through the documents using embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Build an index that can handle search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set Up the Query Engine**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We convert the index into a query engine. This engine will help us run natural language queries on our indexed documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Prepare a query engine that can interpret and respond to user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "query_engine = index.as_query_engine()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query the Documents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We use the query engine to ask, “what is o1,” and then print the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: See how the generative AI app responds to our question using the indexed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "response = query_engine.query(\"what is o1\")\n",
    "print(response)\n",

    "### Exercise: Personalize Your Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll take this app a step further by making it more personal! Here’s what you’ll do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Text File**: \n",
    "   - Copy and paste the content from your LinkedIn profile into a text file.\n",
    "   - Name the file something like `my_linkedin_profile.txt` and save it in the `data` directory.\n",
    "   - Make sure to include all the important details, such as your work experience, skills, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ask Questions About Yourself**: \n",
    "   - Once you’ve added your LinkedIn content to the `data` directory, try running the app and ask questions about your own profile.\n",
    "   - For example, you could ask:\n",
    "     - \"What is my most recent job title?\"\n",
    "     - \"What skills do I have listed?\"\n",
    "     - \"Where did I go to university?\"\n",

    "![Simple RAG](img/0-simple-RAG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll dive deeper into how this system works later on, but here's a quick overview of what you're looking at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured and Unstructured Data**: We start with various types of data, like text documents or structured information.\n",
    "- **Chunking**: Data is broken down into manageable pieces, or \"chunks,\" to be processed.\n",
    "- **Vector DB (Embeddings)**: These chunks are then embedded using a text embedding model and stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- **Response Generation**: The system retrieves relevant chunks based on your query and uses a large language model to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cool thing about this setup is that it abstracts away a lot of the complexity, such as embeddings, vector databases, and chunking. However, as we build and experiment, we need to be mindful of not getting stuck in **POC purgatory**—where we have a great proof-of-concept but never progress to a fully integrated, scalable solution.\n",

    "### Second Iteration: Adding a Front-End with Gradio\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve built the first version of our app, let’s make it more user-friendly by adding a front-end with **Gradio**. We’re also using **PyMuPDF** to handle PDF text extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt Text](img/1-gradio-fe.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What’s New in This Iteration**:\n",
    "- **Front-End with Gradio**: We’ve added a simple Gradio interface that allows you to upload a PDF and ask questions about its contents.\n",
    "- **PDF Handling with PyMuPDF**: Instead of manually working with text, we can now extract text directly from PDFs, making the app more versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gradio Interface**: With just a few lines of code, we’ve created a user-friendly interface:\n",
    "   - A **file upload** component to drag and drop your LinkedIn PDF.\n",
    "   - A **textbox** to type your questions.\n",
    "   - A **button** to submit your queries and get instant responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Minimal Code, Maximum Impact**: \n",
    "   - The Gradio setup is simple yet powerful. It only takes a few lines of code to add an intuitive front-end to our app.\n",
    "   - This demonstrates how easily you can transform a backend script into an interactive AI-powered tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a PDF of Your LinkedIn Profile**:\n",
    "   - Open your LinkedIn profile.\n",

    "### Third Iteration: Enhancing with Local Embeddings and Advanced LLM Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of our app, we’re taking things up a notch by:\n",
    "- Using **Hugging Face embeddings** for efficient, local text representation.\n",
    "- Incorporating the **Ollama API** to query the PDF with an advanced large language model like **LLaMA2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements allow for more flexible and efficient querying, while still keeping the code approachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New in This Iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Embeddings with Hugging Face**:\n",
    "   - We’re now specifying a local embedding model using `HuggingFaceEmbedding`. This gives us more control and flexibility while ensuring data privacy.\n",
    "   - The model we’re using, `\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"`, is lightweight and suitable for many use cases, though it might not perform as well as proprietary models like OpenAI’s embeddings in terms of accuracy and nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ollama API for LLaMA2**:\n",
    "   - We’ve integrated the Ollama API to use **LLaMA2** as our language model, giving us more flexibility in handling complex queries.\n",
    "   - The Ollama integration makes it easy to configure and query the LLM with a simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Considerations for Self-Hosting**:\n",
    "   - You might think that you can just self-host the LLM and call it a day. However, there’s an important nuance: if you want to self-host the entire pipeline, you also need to set up your own **embedding model**.\n",
    "   - The OpenAI API does something clever: it seamlessly handles both the embedding and the generative task for you. When you switch to self-hosted models, you’re responsible for managing the embedding step and ensuring it integrates well with your LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improved User Experience**:\n",
    "   - The app now handles edge cases to make sure it runs smoothly:\n",
    "     - **Ensuring a PDF is Uploaded**: This check is done in the `query_pdf` function:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       if pdf is None:\n",
    "           return \"Please upload a PDF.\"\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       This ensures that the user doesn’t proceed without uploading a file.\n",
    "     - **Validating the Query**: We also check that the query isn’t empty:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       if not query.strip():\n",
    "           return \"Please enter a valid query.\"\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       This makes sure the user provides a meaningful question before processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradio Setup**: We continue to use Gradio to provide a clean and simple front-end.\n",
    "- **Embeddings and LLM**:\n",
    "  - We’re using **Hugging Face** for local embeddings, which brings benefits like:\n",
    "    - **Privacy**: Your data stays on your local machine.\n",
    "    - **Self-Hosting**: You’re not reliant on external APIs.\n",
    "    - **Cost Efficiency**: No need to pay for API calls to third-party services.\n",
    "  - **Trade-Off**: Performance may not be as strong as OpenAI’s models, and you need to manage more of the setup, like embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the Code**: Execute the provided Python code to launch the enhanced version of the app.\n",
    "2. **Upload Your LinkedIn PDF**:\n",
    "   - Use the PDF you created earlier or generate a new one from your LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "3. **Ask More Complex Questions**:\n",
    "   - With these improvements, try asking more detailed or nuanced questions, such as:\n",
    "     - \"Summarize my professional background.\"\n",
    "     - \"List the programming languages I have experience with.\"\n",
    "     - \"What are the key highlights of my career?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment and Reflect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Play Around with Queries**: Observe how the app handles your queries with the new embedding model and LLM integration. You may notice differences in performance compared to using proprietary APIs like OpenAI.\n",
    "- **Consider the Trade-offs**: Remember, self-hosting comes with more responsibilities. Setting up an LLM isn’t just about running the model—you also need to handle embeddings, which OpenAI did seamlessly for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you’re curious about the full code, refer to the `3-app-local.py` file. Feel free to explore and modify it as you like!"

    "### Fourth Iteration: Introducing Conversational Interaction and Model Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, we’re adding a key feature: **conversational memory**. Now, you can have a back-and-forth conversation with the AI to refine your questions and get more precise answers. Additionally, you can choose between a local LLM (Ollama) or OpenAI for generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New in This Iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversational Memory**:\n",
    "   - The app now maintains a **conversation history**, so it can use context from previous questions to give more relevant answers.\n",
    "   - This is particularly useful when you need to ask follow-up questions or clarify information from the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Choice**:\n",
    "   - You can choose between two different models:\n",
    "     - **Local (Ollama)**: Uses a locally hosted model (like LLaMA2) for privacy and self-hosting.\n",
    "     - **OpenAI**: Uses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo, which might provide better performance for nuanced questions but requires an API key.\n",
    "   - The model selection is done through a simple **Gradio radio button** interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights in the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation Handling**:\n",
    "   - The `query_pdf` function now takes a `history` parameter to keep track of the conversation.\n",
    "   - Previous interactions are included in the new query to provide context, making the conversation more coherent:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     conversation = \"\\n\".join([f\"User: {h[0]}\\nAssistant: {h[1]}\" for h in history])\n",
    "     conversation += f\"\\nUser: {query}\\n\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - You can choose between **Ollama** for a local model or **OpenAI** for a cloud-based option:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if model_choice == \"Local (Ollama)\":\n",
    "         llm = Ollama(model=\"llama2\", request_timeout=60.0)\n",
    "     elif model_choice == \"OpenAI\":\n",
    "         openai_api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n",
    "         llm = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - The app now catches exceptions and provides a friendly error message, helping you debug any issues:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     except Exception as e:\n",
    "         return [(\"An error occurred\", str(e))], history\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the Code**: Launch the app and experiment with having a conversation about your LinkedIn PDF.\n",
    "2. **Upload Your PDF**:\n",
    "   - Use the PDF you created earlier or generate a new one from your LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "3. **Ask Follow-Up Questions**:\n",
    "   - Start with a broad question and then ask more specific or clarifying follow-ups. For example:\n",
    "     - \"What are the main highlights of my professional experience?\"\n",
    "     - \"Can you elaborate on my skills related to data science?\"\n",
    "     - \"What is my educational background?\"\n",
    "4. **Switch Models**:\n",
    "   - Experiment with both the **Local (Ollama)** and **OpenAI** models to see how they handle your queries differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Differences**: OpenAI’s model might perform better with complex, nuanced questions, but using it requires an API key and depends on an external service.\n",
    "- **Self-Hosting Trade-Offs**: The local Ollama model provides more privacy and control but might not be as robust or accurate as OpenAI’s offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This iteration brings your app closer to a conversational AI assistant, capable of refining its responses over multiple interactions. Feel free to test and see how well it handles different queries and models!\n",

    "### Fifth Iteration: Adding Logging and Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, we're focusing on **logging** every interaction to a local SQLite database to improve **observability** and **monitoring**. This feature helps us keep track of conversations, queries, and responses, which is essential for debugging, auditing, and improving the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New in This Iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logging Conversations**:\n",
    "   - We’re now storing each conversation and message in a local SQLite database (`qa_traces.db`).\n",
    "   - Every interaction is logged, including the user's queries, the assistant's responses, and any system errors. This gives us a complete trace of each session.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Database Setup**:\n",
    "   - We use **SQLite** for simplicity and set up the database schema to store:\n",
    "     - **Conversations**: A record for each new conversation, with a unique `conversation_id` and a timestamp.\n",
    "     - **Messages**: Each message in the conversation, including its role (`user` or `assistant`), content, and timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Observability with Datasette**:\n",
    "   - We’ll use **Simon Willison’s Datasette** to explore the conversation logs.\n",
    "   - Datasette is a powerful tool for inspecting and querying SQLite databases, making it easy to analyze and understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt Text](img/datasette_traces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights in the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thread-Local Database Connection**:\n",
    "   - We use `threading.local()` to ensure each thread has its own connection to the SQLite database:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     local = threading.local()\n",
    "     def get_db_connection():\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradio Interface**:\n",
    "   - We've added feedback buttons and a message to display the feedback status:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     thumbs_up_button = gr.Button(\"👍\")\n",
    "     thumbs_down_button = gr.Button(\"👎\")\n",

    "### Concepts We've Already Touched On:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**:\n",
    "  - The process we've been following—building, observing, and iterating on our app—embodies the SDLC for generative AI, accounting for iteration needs, observability, and feedback mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Evaluating Model Output**:\n",
    "  - Using the thumbs-up and thumbs-down feedback mechanism, we've begun evaluating model performance and understanding which prompts work better.\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**:\n",
    "  - We've already explored prompt engineering by experimenting with different prompts and observing which ones yield the best results in our apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We’ll Focus On Next:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vendor APIs**:\n",
    "  - We’ll explore APIs such as Groq, Anthropic, and Gemini, discussing their features, limitations, and when to use them.\n",
    "- **Adjusting API Settings (\"Knobs\")**:\n",
    "  - Learn how to control parameters like temperature, max tokens, and frequency penalties to shape model behavior.\n",
    "- **Completion vs. Chat APIs**:\n",
    "  - Discuss the differences between completion-based APIs and chat-based APIs, and when each is most appropriate.\n",
    "- **Non-Determinism**:\n",
    "  - Understand that generative models are inherently non-deterministic, meaning their responses can vary even with the same input. We'll talk about how to handle this in practice.\n",
    "- **What is an Embedding?**:\n",
    "  - Revisit embeddings and understand their role in representing textual data, especially for tasks like search, semantic similarity, and context-based querying.\n",

    "## Conversation Between Mario and Yoda: Using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we use the OpenAI and Anthropic APIs to generate a conversation between two well-known characters: Mario from *Super Mario Bros.* and Yoda from *Star Wars*. By applying specific system prompts, we observe how each model adopts and maintains its assigned role.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Code Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Character Setup**: The OpenAI client is configured to respond as Mario, while the Anthropic client replies in Yoda's distinctive speech style.\n",
    "- **Conversation Loop**: The code initiates a series of exchanges between the two models, with each character responding in turn.\n",
    "- **System Prompts**: We explore how system prompts guide model behavior and help maintain character consistency throughout the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how different vendor APIs can be used to shape model outputs. Let’s examine the conversation and analyze how each model handles its role."

This means that we, as developers, have to manage and provide the previous conversation context ourselves.\n",

By appending each user and assistant message to a `conversation_history` list, we can maintain a coherent and contextualized conversation. This approach enables the assistant to respond in a way that reflects prior exchanges, simulating a more natural and human-like dialogue experience.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Prompt Templates?\n",
    "- **Improved Consistency**: Templates ensure that the responses adhere to a specific structure, which is crucial in fields like marketing, where maintaining a consistent brand voice is important.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Efficiency**: Templates allow for the reuse of formats, saving time on tasks such as drafting emails, creating reports, or generating social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Guidance for the Model**: Clear context and specific instructions within the template help the model produce more relevant and coherent outputs, especially in technical writing or documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility and Creativity**: While templates provide structure, they also allow for creative input. For example, in creative industries, templates can be used for brainstorming ideas while still providing a clear framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Output\n",
    "For instance, in a marketing context, a prompt template might be structured to generate engaging social media posts. You could define fields for the product, target audience, and key message. Given the inputs:\n",
    "- **Product**: Organic Coffee\n",
    "- **Target Audience**: Health-conscious consumers\n",
    "- **Key Message**: Sustainable sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "The model might generate a post like: **\"Start your day with our Organic Coffee! Sustainably sourced and packed with flavor, it's the perfect choice for health-conscious consumers looking for a guilt-free boost.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates how prompt templates can lead to clear, relevant, and engaging content tailored to specific needs. By employing prompt templates in your interactions with language models, you can streamline your content creation process and enhance the overall effectiveness of your communication efforts."

    "\n",
    "1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Understand the purpose of your prompts. Clearly defining what you want to achieve helps in crafting templates that are directly relevant to your goals, whether in marketing, storytelling, or data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incorporate Flexibility**: Design your templates to allow for variation. Use open-ended phrases that encourage the model to generate diverse outputs while maintaining a clear direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Specific Language**: Be explicit in the components of your templates. Instead of vague requests, specify details like the product type, target audience, and key messages. This precision helps the model focus on relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test and Iterate**: After implementing your templates, test them with the model and review the outputs. Gather feedback to refine and improve the templates, enhancing their effectiveness over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Maintain Context**: Provide enough context in your templates to guide the model effectively. Context helps the model understand the tone, style, and audience, leading to more relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Leverage Existing Templates**: Look for established templates relevant to your field. Adapting existing templates can save time and improve the quality of your generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Combine Techniques**: Use templates in conjunction with other parameters, such as temperature and Top-P, to balance creativity and coherence. Adjusting these settings alongside your templates can yield more engaging and diverse outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can enhance your interactions with language models, leading to more consistent and effective results across various applications."

      "Interesting Facts about quantum mechanics: Quantum mechanics is a fascinating and complex branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at very small scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Here are some interesting facts about quantum mechanics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles, such as electrons and photons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This duality is famously illustrated by the double-slit experiment, where particles can create an interference pattern, suggesting they behave like waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Superposition**: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously. For example, a quantum bit (qubit) in a quantum computer can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time, allowing for more complex computations compared to classical bits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Entanglement**: When two particles become entangled, the state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This phenomenon has been described by Einstein as \"spooky action at a distance\" and has implications for quantum communication and computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: This principle states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be precisely measured at the same time. The more accurately you know one, the less accurately you can know the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through potential energy barriers, even if they do not have enough energy to overcome them classically. This phenomenon is crucial in processes like nuclear fusion in stars and is also used in technologies like tunnel diodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Observer Effect**: The act of measurement in quantum mechanics can fundamentally alter the state of a system. This has led to philosophical debates about the nature of reality and the role of the observer in quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Quantum Computing**: Quantum computers use qubits to perform calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers for certain tasks. They harness superposition and entanglement to process information in fundamentally different ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Quantum Cryptography**: Quantum key distribution (QKD) utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to create secure communication channels. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the communication would disturb the quantum states and be detectable.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Quantum Field Theory**: This theoretical framework combines quantum mechanics and special relativity. It describes how particles interact through fields, with particles being excitations of these underlying fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Macroscopic Effects**: While quantum mechanics primarily describes microscopic phenomena, its principles can lead to macroscopic effects, such as superconductivity and superfluidity, where materials exhibit zero resistance or flow without viscosity, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "These facts only scratch the surface of the intricacies and implications of quantum mechanics, a field that continues to challenge our understanding of the universe.\n"
