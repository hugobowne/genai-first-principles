    "In this session, we're building the **first iteration** of an app that queries text files. We'll start with **LlamaIndex** to get something working quickly, but then we will **peel back the layers** to see exactly how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Catch:** While LlamaIndex makes building fast, it hides the complexity. You won't see the prompts or retrieval logic. This is \"Proof-of-Concept Purgatory.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We'll Build:**\n",
    "- **App 1 & 2:** A query app using LlamaIndex abstractions.\n",
    "- **App 3 & 4:** A **Vanilla Python** version where we control every line of code.\n",
    "- **App 5:** Adding **Logging and Observability** with SQLite.\n",
    "- **App 6:** A **Multimodal** app that can read PDFs directly (images and all).\n",

    "   - Source the file: `source .env`\n",

    "\n",
    "### What You'll Do  \n",
    "- Start with `1-app-query.py` to build the **core query engine** for LinkedIn text profiles.\n",
    "- The app will load `.txt` files from the `/data` directory and allow simple querying.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works  \n",
    "We're using **LlamaIndex** to handle the complexity for us. This is the \"Magic Box\" approach:\n",
    "1. **Load documents:** `SimpleDirectoryReader` loads text files from the `/data` directory.\n",
    "2. **Process and index:** LlamaIndex creates embeddings and builds a vector index (we don't see how this works).\n",
    "3. **Query:** When you ask a question, LlamaIndex retrieves relevant context and sends it to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Configure:**\n",
    "- By default, this uses **OpenAI** (`gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4o` depending on your key/defaults) for both embeddings and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Can't See:**\n",
    "- How LlamaIndex constructs the final prompt.\n",
    "- What context gets retrieved from your files.\n",
    "- The exact instructions sent to the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "If you prefer to use other providers, we have set up alternative scripts:\n",
    "- `1a-app-query-gemini.py` (uses Google Gemini)\n",

    "\n",
    "![Gradio App](img/gradio-app.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the query engine works, let's wrap it in a user interface.  \n",
    "- We'll use `2-app-front-end.py` to create a **Gradio frontend**.  \n",
    "- This allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions via a web browser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works  \n",
    "1. **PDF Upload:** Users upload PDF files through the Gradio interface.\n",
    "2. **Text Extraction:** The app uses `PyMuPDF` to extract text from the uploaded PDF.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Indexing:** A new LlamaIndex vector index is created on the fly for the uploaded file.\n",
    "4. **Query Interface:** Users type questions and get responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "Unlike App 1, which pre-loaded files from a folder, this version builds the index *dynamically* when you upload a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run the App:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python apps/2-app-front-end.py\n",

    "*Click the local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) to open the interface.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:**  \n",
    "While this looks like a complete app, we are still in \"Proof of Concept Purgatory.\" We have no logs, we don't know what the model is actually seeing, and debugging is difficult."
