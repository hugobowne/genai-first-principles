    "## Basic Multi-LLM Workflows -- The Agentic Continuum\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the concepts of augmenting LLMs to create workflows that range from simple task processing to more complex agent-like behavior. Think of this as a continuum—from standalone LLMs to fully autonomous agents, with a variety of workflows and augmentations in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow [a schema inspired by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), starting with three foundational workflow types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt-Chaining**: Decomposes a task into sequential subtasks, where each step builds on the results of the previous one.\n",
    "2. **Parallelization**: Distributes independent subtasks across multiple LLMs for concurrent processing.\n",
    "3. **Routing**: Dynamically selects specialized LLM paths based on input characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these workflows, we'll explore how LLMs can be leveraged effectively for increasingly complex tasks. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why This Matters\n",
    "In real-world applications, single LLM calls often fall short of solving complex problems. Consider these scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content Moderation: Effectively moderating social media requires multiple checks - detecting inappropriate content, understanding context, and generating appropriate responses\n",
    "- Customer Service: A support system needs to understand queries, route them to specialists, generate responses, and validate them for accuracy and tone\n",
    "- Quality Assurance: Business-critical LLM outputs often need validation and refinement before being sent to end users\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these workflow patterns, you can build more robust and reliable LLM-powered applications that go beyond simple prompt-response interactions."

    "### When to Use\n",
    "The Orchestrator-Worker workflow is ideal when:\n",
    "- You need to dynamically delegate tasks to specialized components based on input characteristics or the context of the task.\n",
    "- Tasks require multiple steps, with different workers responsible for distinct parts of the process.\n",
    "- Flexibility is required to manage varying subtasks while ensuring seamless coordination and aggregation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- **Generating tailored emails**: Routing LinkedIn profiles to specialized workers that create emails customized for different industries or audiences.\n",
    "- **Multi-step workflows**: Breaking down tasks into subtasks, dynamically assigning them to workers, and synthesizing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1. **Orchestrator**:\n",
    "   - Centralized controller responsible for delegating tasks to the appropriate workers.\n",
    "   - Manages input and coordinates workflows across multiple steps.\n",
    "2. **Workers**:\n",
    "   - Specialized components designed to handle specific subtasks, such as generating industry-specific email templates.\n",
    "   - Operate independently, performing their roles based on instructions from the orchestrator.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Routing**:\n",
    "   - Enables the orchestrator to assign tasks based on input characteristics (e.g., classifying as \"Tech\" or \"Non-Tech\").\n",
    "4. **Result Aggregator**:\n",
    "   - Combines results from workers into a cohesive final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "**Scenario**: Generating tailored emails for LinkedIn profiles.\n",
    "1. **Input**: A LinkedIn profile text.\n",
    "2. **Process**:\n",
    "   - The **orchestrator** analyzes the LinkedIn profile and routes it to a classification worker.\n",
    "   - The classification worker determines if the profile belongs to \"Tech\" or \"Non-Tech.\"\n",
    "   - Based on the classification, the orchestrator routes the profile to the appropriate email generation worker.\n",
    "   - The email generation worker produces a professional email tailored to the classification.\n",
    "3. **Output**: A professional email customized to the recipient’s industry type."

    "### **Orchestrator-Worker Workflow Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Orchestrator's Role**:\n",
    "  - The orchestrator's main task is to **analyze** the LinkedIn profile and **classify** the industry (Tech or Not Tech).\n",
    "  - Once the industry is classified, the orchestrator **routes the task** to the appropriate **worker** for email generation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Worker's Role**:\n",
    "  - The **Tech Worker** generates a **hiring email** tailored for profiles in the **Tech industry**.\n",
    "  - The **Non-Tech Worker** generates a **hiring email** tailored for profiles in the **Non-Tech industry**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Email Generation**:\n",
    "  - The **worker** generates an email using the **specific prompt** for the classified industry.\n",
    "  - **No synthesis** is performed yet, as only one email is generated based on the industry classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Possible Future Enhancements**:\n",
    "  - Although **no synthesis** is used in this example, we could add a **synthesizing step** to combine **multiple outputs** (e.g., emails for different tasks or industries) into a **single report** for **verification or analysis**.\n",
    "  - **Synthesizing** could be used to create a comprehensive summary or report that contains all relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Orchestrator-Worker vs Routing Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Orchestrator-Worker Workflow**:\n",
    "  - **Multiple Subtasks**: The orchestrator breaks down the task into **multiple subtasks** that can be handled by **different workers**.\n",
    "  - **Dynamic Routing**: Based on the profile content, the orchestrator routes the task to **specialized workers** (e.g., Tech Worker vs Non-Tech Worker).\n",
    "  - **Parallel or Sequential**: Subtasks can either be handled **sequentially** (as in this example) or **in parallel** (if we choose to process multiple subtasks concurrently).\n",
    "  - **Example in This Case**: The orchestrator assigns **industry classification** to one worker and then routes the email generation task to **one of two workers** based on the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Routing Workflow**:\n",
    "  - **Single Task**: In a routing workflow, the orchestrator routes the **entire task** to a **single worker**.\n",
    "  - **Simpler Routing Logic**: There is no breakdown of tasks into multiple subtasks, so there’s **no delegation to different workers** for different parts of the task.\n",
    "  - **Fixed Worker**: The system chooses one path and assigns the entire task to one worker based on the classification (e.g., \"hiring\" leads to the worker responsible for hiring emails).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why This Is Orchestrator-Worker**:\n",
    "  - **Multiple Tasks and Workers**: The orchestrator is breaking down the process into **multiple tasks** (industry classification and email generation) and **delegating those tasks** to **different workers**.\n",
    "  - **Dynamic Task Assignment**: The orchestrator doesn't route the task to a fixed worker; instead, it dynamically assigns the task to either the **Tech Worker** or **Non-Tech Worker** based on the classification.\n",
    "  - This design meets the core principles of an **orchestrator-worker workflow**, where **tasks are divided into subtasks** and **delegated** to **specialized workers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This implementation is an **Orchestrator-Worker Workflow** because the orchestrator is responsible for **classifying the input** (industry), then routing it to **different workers** based on that classification.\n",
    "- The orchestrator **delegates** the task to the appropriate worker, which is a defining feature of an orchestrator-worker workflow.\n",
    "- We are **not synthesizing** any outputs in this example, but a **synthesizer** could be added later if we need to combine multiple outputs (e.g., emails for different tasks) into a single report for further analysis."

    "### When to Use\n",
    "The Evaluator-Optimizer workflow is ideal when:\n",
    "- **Iterative improvement** is needed to refine outputs to meet specific quality criteria.\n",
    "- Clear evaluation criteria are available, and iterative refinement provides measurable value.\n",
    "- The task benefits from a feedback loop, where an evaluator assesses the output and provides actionable guidance for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- **Refining email drafts**: Ensuring emails adhere to professional tone, grammar, and relevance to the audience.\n",
    "- **Polishing translations**: Enhancing literary or technical translations for accuracy, tone, and cultural relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. **Generator**:\n",
    "   - Produces the initial output, such as a draft email or translation.\n",
    "   - Provides the starting point for the evaluator’s analysis.\n",
    "2. **Evaluator**:\n",
    "   - Reviews the generator’s output and compares it against predefined criteria (e.g., clarity, tone, accuracy).\n",
    "   - Identifies areas for improvement and suggests refinements.\n",
    "3. **Optimizer**:\n",
    "   - Modifies the output based on the evaluator’s feedback.\n",
    "   - Iteratively refines the output until it satisfies the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "**Scenario**: Improving an outreach email for professionalism and tone.\n",
    "1. **Input**: An email draft generated from a LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "2. **Process**:\n",
    "   - The **generator** creates an initial email based on the profile’s information.\n",
    "   - The **evaluator** reviews the email for clarity, grammatical accuracy, and audience alignment.\n",
    "   - If improvements are needed, the **optimizer** revises the email using the evaluator’s feedback.\n",
    "   - The cycle repeats until the evaluator confirms the email meets all quality criteria.\n",
    "3. **Output**: A hopefully polished email that is professional, clear, and tailored to the recipient.\n"

    "This was an example of the **Evaluator-Optimizer workflow** for improving email generation based on a LinkedIn profile. The process includes:\n",

    "1. **Email Generation**: The email is initially generated based on the LinkedIn profile using a talent acquisition specialist prompt.\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**: The generated email is then evaluated for professionalism, tone, and clarity.\n",
    "3. **Optimization**: The email is refined based on the feedback provided by the evaluator, resulting in an improved version of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve focused on a **single iteration** of generation, evaluation, and optimization to demonstrate the core workflow. However, in practice, **multiple iterations** can often yield even better results, especially for complex tasks. After each iteration, the evaluator’s feedback can be used to refine the output further. \n",

    "**Stop Conditions**:\n",
    "- To avoid unnecessary iterations, you can set **stop conditions** based on specific criteria, such as:\n",
    "  - If the evaluator feedback score improves by less than a predefined threshold.\n",
    "  - If the feedback indicates no further changes are needed.\n",
    "\n",
