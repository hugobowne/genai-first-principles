    "## What This Covers\n",
    "Single LLM calls often aren't enough. This notebook explores workflow patterns [inspired by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential steps where each builds on the previous\n",
    "2. **Parallelization**: Independent tasks running concurrently  \n",
    "3. **Routing**: Dynamic selection of specialized paths\n",
    "4. **Orchestrator-Workers**: Coordinating multiple specialized LLMs for complex tasks\n",
    "5. **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Iterative refinement with feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:** How to decompose complex problems into LLM workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the end:** You'll understand when and how to use each pattern for real-world applications."

      "The email focuses heavily on praising Elliot but doesn't clearly explain what's in it for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestion:** Add one sentence about benefits, growth potential, or unique aspects of your company.\n",

    "You've now seen five workflow patterns for coordinating multiple LLM calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential steps building on each other\n",
    "2. **Parallelization**: Independent tasks running concurrently\n",
    "3. **Routing**: Dynamic path selection based on input type\n",
    "4. **Orchestrator-Workers**: Central coordinator delegating to specialized workers\n",
    "5. **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Iterative refinement through feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:** Complex AI applications rarely use a single LLM call. These patterns help you structure multi-LLM workflows for reliability, efficiency, and quality."
