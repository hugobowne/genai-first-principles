    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "In Session 6a, you learned function calling—how to connect LLMs to external systems. While function calling connects LLMs to external systems, these workflows show how to coordinate multiple LLM calls to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Covers\n",
    "Single LLM calls often aren't enough. This notebook explores workflow patterns [inspired by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential steps where each builds on the previous\n",
    "2. **Parallelization**: Independent tasks running concurrently  \n",
    "3. **Routing**: Dynamic selection of specialized paths\n",
    "4. **Orchestrator-Workers**: Coordinating multiple specialized LLMs for complex tasks\n",
    "5. **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Iterative refinement with feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:** How to decompose complex problems into LLM workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the end:** You'll understand when and how to use each pattern for real-world applications."

    "You've now seen five workflow patterns for coordinating multiple LLM calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential steps building on each other\n",
    "2. **Parallelization**: Independent tasks running concurrently\n",
    "3. **Routing**: Dynamic path selection based on input type\n",
    "4. **Orchestrator-Workers**: Central coordinator delegating to specialized workers\n",
    "5. **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Iterative refinement through feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:** Complex AI applications rarely use a single LLM call. These patterns help you structure multi-LLM workflows for reliability, efficiency, and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coming up next:** We'll demo the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard for building reusable tool servers. Instead of reimplementing GitHub APIs, search functions, or other tools for each application, MCP lets you define them once and make them discoverable to any LLM that supports the protocol."
